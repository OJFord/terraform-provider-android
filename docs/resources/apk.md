# android_apk `Resource`

Provides an Android APK resource. This can be used to create, read, update, and delete installed APKs (apps) on your Android device.

## System dependencies

Currently CRUDing an `android_apk` resource depends on the following binaries in `$PATH`:
- `adb` (from android-tools)

For `method="gplaycli"`:
- `gplaycli` (from python-pip: gplaycli)

It is intended to reduce/eliminate these (cf. [GitHub#4](//github.com/OJFord/terraform-provider-android/issues/4)), but for now, they're required (on the machine running `terraform`).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "android_apk" "example" {
  endpoint = "192.168.1.123:5555"
  name     = "com.example.app"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **name** (String) Qualified name of the package to install, e.g. `com.google.zxing.client.android`

### Optional

- **endpoint** (String) IP:PORT of the device. Required for ADB over WiFi, omit for USB connections.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **method** (String) Method to use for acquiring the APK. (aurora, fdroid, gplaycli). `"aurora"` requires `com.aurora.store.debug`, currently a forked version, but which it can install to bootstrap itself.
- **serial** (String) Serial number (`getprop ro.serialno`) of the device.

### Read-Only

- **version** (Number) Monotonically increasing `versionCode` of the package, safe for comparison
- **version_name** (String) Human-friendly `versionName`, defined by the package author and not guaranteed to increment
